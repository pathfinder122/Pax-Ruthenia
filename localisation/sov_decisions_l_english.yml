 SOV_internal_factions_desc:1 "Ever since the foundation of the Russian Republic, there has always been political infighting. The situation had grown even worse with the 1927 Black Hundreds coup and the subsequent 1930 elections. Now, the extremists on the left as well as the right are planning their moves, and with the exiles of the tsarist, the Black Hundreds and the Soviets, the Russian Republic must choose their path wisely. \n\n                       §RAll of Russia depends on it.§"

 SOV_CONSERVATIVE_TOOLTIP:0 "The Union of Russian People is a nationalist organization founded in the division of the United Democracts, currently led by far-right politician and fomer Black Hundresdist Alexander Trishatny  \n\nThe Union of Russian People are close to usurping the 29-year Kerensky regime, and ushering in a new age for Russia."
 SOV_LIBERAL_TOOLTIP:0 "The Kadets are social-democrats supporting Alexander Kerensky and the Russian Republic. The party almost solely belong to Kerensky himself. \n\nThe Kadets will actively fight any attempt of a takeover, and would be a hard challange to overcome even in a democratic yictory, given their popularity."
 SOV_SOCIALIST_TOOLTIP:0 "The New Russian Socialist Party is a political organization created in 1930, after Kerensky's victory in the Emergency Election. \n\nThe New Socialist Party of Russia, led by People's Guard captain Julius Martov, fights for social reform, but has a long way to go in order to compete in a serious election."
 SOV_FASCIST_TOOLTIP:0 "The Russian Fascist Party is a far-right organization led by Konstantin Rodzaevsky, which calls for a "New Russian State". \n\nThe Russian Fascist Party has strong connections with the outlawed Black Hundreds, and will likely attempt to stage a coup if they get powerful enough."
 SOV_HUNDREDS_TOOLIP:0: "The Black Hundreds are an ultranationalist organization that has been banned in their 1927 coup. Formerly led by Pyotr Wrangel, the Black Hundreds now lay scattered and disorganized, but with many symapthisers throughout. \n\nWith Russia in crisis, the Black Hundreds may once again rise, and attempt to fight for the nation. §RGod help us if they succeed§
 SOV_MILITARY_TOOLTIP:0 "The National Revival Front is the military's attempt to avoid the Depoliticization Acts by forming their own party. \n\nBorn in the wake of the Black Hundreds Coup, Anton Denikin had announced his own party, to restore order in Russia."
 SOV_COMMUNIST_TOOLTIP:0 "Beaten but not defeated, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, or the Soviet Union, is a group of covert Soviet members led by Leon Trotsky and Georgy Zhukov. \n\nThe Soviet Union is weak and disorganized, but should we forget about them, we will come to regret it."
 SOV_TSARIST_TOOLTIP:0 "The restorationists are those who wish to see the Romanovs returned to their place on the head of Russia. Leaderless but throughout, they find support in the URP and the NRF. \n\nA weak organization with little political basis, they are mostly forgotten about by the major factions, but should a drastic shift occur in politics, they might yet succeed."
 SOV_LOYALTY_TOOLTIP:0 "§YLoyalty§! represents the faction's desire to cooperate with the government. \nThe higher the §YLoyalty§!, the less likely it is that a faction will confront the government. \nBefore integrating a faction into the government, it is necessary to complete certain decisions to align their members with the government and increase their §YLoyalty§! to 100."
 SOV_POPULARITY_TOOLTIP:0 "§YPopularity§! represents the support a faction receives from certain sectors of the population (be they military, proletarian, peasant or right-wing radicals). \nThe higher the §YPopularity§!, the more likely it is that a faction will confront the government. \nBefore destroying a faction, it is necessary to complete certain decisions to weaken it and reduce its §YPopularity§! to 0."
