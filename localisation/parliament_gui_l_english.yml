  parliament_gui_decision_category_desc:0 "The Russian Duma has been the staple of a true Russian democracy. No matter if one is in a mainstream party, such as the Kadets or URP, or a radical faction, like the NSPR or RFP, all Russian people get a voice on the Duma. For as long as the Russian Duma remains alive, it will be a shining light in Russia, protecting it from the darkness of communism and national-socialism"
