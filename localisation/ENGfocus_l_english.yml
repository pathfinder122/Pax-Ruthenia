 ENG_dying_nation_desc:0 "The Pax Britannica's end is inevitable, Britain is in the last days of its golden age so now is the time to try and prevent it. Poverty across the colonies, political unrest and an old economy have failed our nation. If we can eliminate all these issues by all means necessary, maybe, just maybe we can still be a superpower."
 ENG_fading_colonies:0 "Fading Colonies..."
 ENG_fading_colonies_desc:0 "Riots in India, Protests in Palestine, Guerilla warfare in Malaya, the Empire is crumbling, we need to stop treating the 400 million people we rule as second class citizens. Be it through third world industrialisation, decolonisation or ruling with an iron first we musn't let the empire fall!"
 ENG_fading_economy:0 "Fading Economy..."
 ENG_fading_economy_desc:0 "For 900 years England has been a beacon of glory and power. We must maintain our age old legacy and keep the economy afloat. Russia and Japan to the East and America to the West threaten our dominance and their economies have already surpassed ours. Rapid construction and industrialisation is what the country and empire need."
